                  <p>Matt and his team at Daedalic are hard at work on building out Ken Follett’s “Pillars of the Earth” as a full-scale graphic adventure. If you haven’t seen it yet, be sure to check out the preview trailer that their studio is now promoting!</p>

                  <h2>Cabaret Noir, by Happenstance Theater</h2>
                  <p class="date">November 1st, 2015 by greg</p>
                  <p>Happenstance Theater, the voice cast behind <em>Tick</em> and many characters in <em>Stitch</em>, are at it again with a new show called <em>Cabaret Noir</em>. The show is an original production featuring a series of dark comedic sketches in the motif of classic film noir, and plays at The Baltimore Theater Project (Baltimore, MD) through mid-November. The show is fabulous, and includes an ironic cameo…</p>
                  <p><img class="photo" title="Cabaret Noir" src="media/news/cabaret_noir.jpg" alt="Cabaret Noir" width="505" height="325"></p>
                  <p>Alex Vernon (voice of Nathan) has a running character part costumed in a brown tweed suit with a collar tie tucked into his waistcoat. He looks (and sounds) a whole lot like Nathan! He even sports a pocket flip-lighter to ignite the dames’ cigarettes. While the costume panned out through total coincidence, Alex noted that the caricature similarities are ironic. If you’re in the Baltimore area, you should definitely check out this fabulous show and support a wonderful independent theater company.</p>
                  <p>Pictured above is Alex Vernon (voice of Nathan), with Sarah Olmsted Thomas (voice of Nora) in Happenstance Theater’s original production, <em>Cabaret Noir</em>.</p>

                  <p class="date">July 14th, 2015 by greg</p>
                  <p><img class="photo" title="The What Makes You Tick? Series" src="media/news/wmyt_series.jpg" alt="" width="505" height="832"></p>
                  <p>Folks, it’s the end of an era. Since the original 2007 release of <em>What Makes You Tick?</em>, these games have been an ongoing adventure for Matt and I. From evolutions in technology, to new language translations, to full blown voice casts; the <em>Tick</em> games have remained close to our hearts, and their characters our dear friends. Each new evolution of these games has brought something wonderful, and we’re thrilled to conclude with the ultimate realization of these characters, as brought to life by our wonderful vocal cast. Also coming full-circle back to Matt’s original 2007 freeware release, we’re proud to be sunsetting these games to where they belong: into the hands of our fans, as indie freeware downloads (mind the hodge-podge of free download hosting providers that we’re linking to!).</p>
                  <p>But most importantly, we’ve made some great friends and gone some great places along this journey. To all of our friends and fans: we thank you for joining us on the ride. What’s next? Well, we’re just a couple of guys pursuing our lives and careers, which is of course a full-time adventure. So is this the end for Nathan, Nigel, and the world of <em>What Makes You Tick</em>? Possibly, but then time also works in funny ways… who can really say when the clockwork stops ticking?</p>
                  <p>Without further ado, download and enjoy:</p>

                  <h2>Series release date: 7/14/15</h2>
                  <p class="date">July 7th, 2015 by greg</p>
                  <p>The complete “What Makes You Tick?” talkie series will release next Tuesday, July 14, 2015. It’s the end of an era, and we’re excited to finally put the talkie <em>Stitch</em> release out to the world. The games will be released as a bundle: <em>Tick</em> is included as English talkie with Spanish subtitles, and <em>Stitch</em> is included as English talkie with German subtitles.</p>
                  <p>The games will be released for free download, although we need your help. Bandwidth is not free, and it tallies up quickly when distributing a 450Mb file. We’ll be seeding a torrent link, so we ask you all to please (pretty please!) be ready to grab the torrent rather than an HTTP download. We will post the file to a Dropbox, but that won’t service more than a few hundred downloads. We <em>really</em> need you all to help us out with torrenting during the first few days. We will also post the file to our storefront where you can purchase the file for a negligible price (probably $1) which is basically paying our store provider for servicing the download.</p>
                  <p>Also note: download links will be distributed via <em>email</em> to avoid automated traffic hitting our download links. It’s nothing malicious, we have no intention of selling or abusing your email address. It’s just a good, reliable way to make sure we’re give the little bandwidth that we have to humans.</p>

                  <p><em>Tick</em> fans, this you’ve got to see:</p>

                  <p>Look familiar? While it could certainly be a coincidence, the parallel is uncanny. Way to go, Matt! You either inspired a marketing campaign, or else beat an agency to the concept by seven years.</p>

                  <h2>The “What Makes You Tick?” Series</h2>
                  <p class="date">June 8th, 2015 by greg</p>
                  <p>Huge news: after a full year of casting, recording, and editing over six-thousand lines of dialog from twenty-five performers, the Stitch talkie is finished. The last of the pickups are being polished now, and the build is in a closed beta. It was a haul, but it sounds great!</p>
                  <p>Now to address a long-standing FAQ: how will the Stitch talkie be released? Answer: the talkie versions of “What Makes You Tick?” and “A Stitch in Time” will be bundled together, and released for download as freeware. Freeware, as in… FREE.</p>
                  <p>After some discussion, Matt and I decided this was the most sensible course of action. It’s pretty clear at this point that <em>Stitch</em> production costs will not break even – and that’s okay, because we had a good time building it and we’ve made some great friends along the way. The game certainly helped launch Matt’s career into Daedalic Entertainment, and laid some groundwork for material that later evolved into “Night of the Rabbit”. Great things came from the project, even if financial success was not one of them. Now, as five year old Flash games drifting into the sunset of their era, our biggest return on investment is simply to put these games into the hands of our fans… and what better way to do that than to return to the roots of WMYT’s 2007 freeware debut.</p>
                  <p>That’s the word. We’ll be following up soon with a release date.</p>

                  <h2>Stitch Talkie Update</h2>
                  <p class="date">April 12th, 2015 by greg</p>
                  <p>It’s been a while since the Stitch talkie announcement, so we owe you all an update. Let’s cover all the bases…</p>
                  <p>Matt is busy working at Daedalic Entertainment, and we can now publicly say that his current project is a <a href="https://press.daedalic.com/new-game-based-on-the-pillars-of-the-earth-begins-this-summer">Ken Follett game</a>. Matt has met with the renowned author, and is building an exciting new adventure based on one of his works.</p>
                  <p>I (Greg) have been busy working at <a href="http://www.voxmedia.com">Vox Media</a> on features across all publications, including <a href="http://polygon.com">Polygon</a>, <a href="http://theverge.com">The Verge</a>, and our newcomer <a href="http://vox.com">Vox</a>. I’ve also been teaching a night course for the past quarter which has taken up a lot of time.</p>
                  <p>The Stitch talkie is about 95% complete. It’s been a HUGE recording effort for an indie production: 6100 lines of dialog from 37 characters, all of which needs to be recorded, edited, and then mastered into the game. Overall, we’re really happy with the sound of it! Good news: all original cast members from the Tick talkie have returned to their respective roles. Between Alex (Nathan), Sarah (Nora), and now Travis (Nigel), the lead roles are quite strong. I think we’ve now finally found a Lionstone, which was the last major uncast part.</p>
                  <p>ALSO: we’re actively seeking a proofreader to polish up the existing German screenplay to match the final English recording screenplay. Please <a href="#contact">contact me</a> if you’d be interested in working on this project. That’s the word. Sorry we don’t have a hard release date, but at least progress is being made.</p>

                  <p class="date">November 17th, 2014 by greg</p>
                  <p>Who’s this guy? He looks kind of like Nigel Trelawney. He sounds like Nigel too… </p>
                  <p><img class="photo" title="Nigel Trelawney" src="media/news/stitch-talkie.jpg" alt="" width="505" height="284"></p>
                  <p>Introducing Travis Vander Hoop, the voice of Nigel Trelawney in the “What Makes You Tick: A Stitch in Time” talkie. After many months of quietly recording audio, we can say with some certainly that the game will be ready for release in early 2015. Stay tuned!</p>

                  <h2>What Makes You Tick?, The Talkie</h2>
                  <p class="date">April 2nd, 2014 by greg</p>
                  <p>Announcing: What Makes You Tick?, The Talkie. After eight years of silent subtitles, the Tick characters are finally coming to life with an audio drama performed by the fabulous <a href="https://www.happenstancetheater.com">Happenstance Theater</a> company! It sounds great, and we’re really excited to share it with our friends and fans. The talkie is currently in beta, and should be released in the coming month. Stay tuned!!</p>
                  <p><img class="photo" title="Recording What Makes You Tick?" src="media/news/wmyt-recording.jpg" alt="" width="505" height="284"></p>
                  <p>Unfortunately we still have no plans to record a talkie for the sequel, “A Stitch in Time”. Stitch is about x10 the size of the original WMYT game, so would be a formidable undertaking as a hobby recording project. However… never say never, right?</p>
