  <section class="about">
    <h3>The original "A Stitch in Time"</h3>
    <img src="assets/images/stitch_intro.jpg" alt="" class="border"/>
    <div>
      <p>Started in 2008 and in production for two years, the <em>What Makes You Tick: A Stitch in Time</em> sequel grew into an ambitious production for two developers. A detailed new story was crafted; a huge new world was drawn and painted; dozens of new characters were concieved and animated; and the <a href="https://github.com/gmac/lassie-shepherd">Lassie game engine</a> was completely re-programmed. <em>Stitch</em> was released in September of 2010 a downloadable Adobe AIR application.</p>

    <h3>Localization</h3>
    <img src="assets/images/localization.jpg" alt="" class="border"/>
    <div>
      <p>Shortly after release, <em>Stitch</em> was picked up by a publisher and went into localized production. The game was translated into German and Russian, although only the German version was ever released. It reached store shelves on CD-ROM. Later, <em>What Makes You Tick?</em> was also localized by fans into German and Spanish and was released for online play.</p>

    <h3>The 2015 Talkie</h3>
    <img src="assets/images/talkie.jpg" alt="" class="border"/>
    <div>
      <p>While the <em>What Makes You Tick?</em> talkie was met with enthuasiasm, the prospect of recording <em>Stitch</em> was daunting due to its sheer size (6,000 vs. 600 lines). It all came down to finding the voice of Nigel who would carry the bulk of the recording. Lo and behold, Greg spent the summer working with Travis Van Der Hoop, who's improvisational wit matched the role. Audio production ran for a year and saw the return of all the original <em>Tick</em> actors.</p>

    <h3>Night of the Rabbit</h3>
    <img src="assets/images/rabbit.jpg" alt="" class="border"/>
    <div>
      <p>Following the release of <em>A Stitch in Time</em>, Matt joined <a href="https://www.daedalic.com/">Daedalic Entertainment</a> to work as author, artist, and director of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2013/5/28/4361374/the-night-of-the-rabbit-review-last-day-of-summer">Night of the Rabbit</a>. This charming magical world introduced countless new figments of his imagination along with some familiar elements: the day/night world clock returned; Dr. Pepper and Ravenhollow both made cameo appearances; and the end reveal of <em>Rabbit</em> built directly upon the culmination of <em>A Stitch in Time</em>.</p>
