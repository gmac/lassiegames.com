  <h2>Walkthrough</h2>

  <p class="hint">I want to get the key from the crow! ... <em>you have to sedate the crow, you can find instructions in the book the sailor gives you.</em></p>

  <p class="hint">How? What ingredients do I need? ... <em>you need the cocktail shaker (bin of scrap metal at the field), wheat from the field, alcohol given by the sailor, and a Seta de Muerte mushroom.</em></p>

  <p class="hint">Where do I get the mushroom? ... <em>the dog will find it for you if you show him the book.</em></p>

  <p class="hint">The dog is sleeping. How can I wake him up? ... <em>give him a fish to get his attention. To get fish, build a fishing rod and go fishing.</em></p>

  <p class="hint">How do I build a fishing rod? ... <em>take the leaflet from the old ferry timetable by the dock for instructions and a fishing hook.</em></p>

  <p class="hint">What else do I need for the fishing rod? ... <em>a float (bite the cork from the bottle), a stick (from the flag by the house), a piece of string (behind the raven gate), and bait (find a worm under a stone by the shed near the field).</em></p>

  <p class="hint">The raven gate is closed. How do I get in there? ... <em>you have to pick the lock (try the barbed wire from the fence in front of Nora).</em></p>

  <p class="hint">I can't get barbed wire. I need something to protect my hands! ... <em>take the glove next to Nora, then get the other one from the crab on the beach.</em></p>

  <p class="hint">The crab won't leave the glove! ... <em>find a better shell for him, like a Dr. Pepper can (get it from the traveler, Greg, who appears near the well after you've picked up the cocktail shaker).</em></p>

  <p class="hint">I sedated the crow and got part of a key. Where are the other parts? ... <em>talk to Nora about her sickness. She'll give you another key part.</em></p>

  <p class="hint">That's two key parts. Where's the third? ... <em>Nora has gone to the dock, talk to her and the sailor there. Then go back to the fields and talk to her grandfather who has appeared. He'll tell you where to find the final key part, and you may enter the house.</em></p>

  <p class="hint">I'm in the house. Now what do I do? ... <em>in the base of the golden bird statue are two oval-shaped sockets. Find the plates that fit in those.</em></p>

  <p class="hint">Where do I find the plates for the golden bird statue? ... <em>light the lantern near the well with your lighter; then you'll be able to see something shiny stuck in the side of the wooden box. Take the dirty metal plate. Douse the cloth from the flag in alcohol and use that to clean it.</em></p>

  <p class="hint">That's one plate. Where's the other? ... <em>search the bookshelf to the right of the bird statue. Find an interesting blue book, take and open it, then insert both plates into the sockets of the bird statue.</em></p>

  <p class="hint">I'm in the cellar. How do I get past that gate? ... <em>try to take the picture on the wall. You'll find a hole in the wall. Use the handle from the well with it and crank it.</em></p>

  <p class="hint">I'm trapped and someone stole all my stuff! What do I do? ... <em>go back to the gate and talk to the crow to wake him up and then jump on the handle. In the cupboard under the binoculars you'll find your items.</em></p>

  <p class="hint">I'm still trapped. So how can I escape? ... <em>you have to activate the escape pod; ask Coppelius for instructions. First ignite the fishing club leaflet with your lighter and throw it into the tank. Then throw in two other flammable items containing alcohol: seeds, bottle or wet cloth. Escape using the pod.</em></p>

  <p class="hint">I escaped. Now what? ... <em>go back to the house and restore the plates in their sockets to get back into the cellar.</em></p>

  <p class="hint">Finally you and the old man are free again, but where's Vincent? ... <em>watch the last sequences for answers!</em></p>
