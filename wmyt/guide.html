  <h2>Walkthrough</h2>
  <p>I want to get the key from the crow!</p>
  <p class="hint">You have to sedate the crow, you can find instructions in the book the sailor gives you after talking to him.</p>

  <p>How? What ingredients do I need?</p>
  <p class="hint">You need the cocktail shaker (ton of scrap metal at the field), wheat from the field, alcohol (the sailor gives you one after talking to him) and the "Seta de Muerte"</p>

  <p>Where do I get the Mushroom ("Seta de Muerte")?</p>
  <p class="hint">The dog will find it for you if you show him the book</p>

  <p>The dog is sleeping. How can I wake him up?</p>
  <p class="hint">You have to wake him up by giving him fish. To get fish you have to build a fishing rod.</p>

  <p>How do I build a fishing rod?</p>
  <p class="hint">Take the leaflet from the old ferry timetable near the sea - you'll get instructions and a fishing hook.</p>

  <p>What else do I need for the rod?</p>
  <p class="hint">Something floating (cork from bottle - bite to open), a stick (it stuck in the ground next to the sign near the house with a piece of cloth tied to it), a piece of string (behind the raven gate) and bait (worm under stone next to the ton of scrap metal)</p>

  <p>The raven gate is closed. How do I get in there?</p>
  <p class="hint">You have to pick the lock (try using barbed wire from the fence in front of Nora)</p>

  <p>I can't get barbed wire. I need something to protect my hands!</p>
  <p class="hint">Take the glove next to Nora. The crab at the beach is living in the other one.</p>

  <p>The crab won't leave the glove! Help!</p>
  <p class="hint">Well, find something that's much better to live in - like a can of Dr Pepper (get it from Greg, the traveler, he'll appear in near the well after you picked up the cocktail shaker).</p>

  <p>I sedated the crow and got a part of a key. Now, where are the other parts?</p>
  <p class="hint">Go to Nora and you'll find that she's sick. If you talk to her she'll give you another key part. Go back to the house and then go back to Nora. She's gone now - you'll find her at the beach. Talk to her and the sailor. Then go back to the fields - next to the bench her grandfather will wait and tell you where to find the last part. Now you may enter the house.</p>

  <p>I'm in the house. Now what do I do?</p>
  <p class="hint">In the base of the statue you'll find two oval shaped holes. Find the plates that fit in there to continue.</p>

  <p>Where do I find the plates for the golden bird statue?</p>
  <p class="hint">Light the lantern near the well. After that you'll be able to see something shiny stuck in the side of the wooden box. Take it. It's a dirty metal plate. Use the cloth, that was tied to the long stick, with alcohol and clean the plate. The second metal plate can be found in the bookshelf to the right of the bird statue. Search for an interesting blue book, take and open it. Now insert the plates into the holes of the bird statue.</p>

  <p>I'm in the cellar. How do I get past that gate?</p>
  <p class="hint">Try to take the picture on the wall. You'll find a hole in the wall. Use the handle from the well with it and push it.</p>

  <p>I'm trapped and someone stole all my stuff! What do I do?</p>
  <p class="hint">Go back to the gate and talk to the crow to wake him up and then jump on the handle. In the cupboard under the binoculars you'll find your items.</p>

  <p>I'm still trapped. So how can I escape?</p>
  <p class="hint">You have to activate the escape pod, ask Coppelius to get instructions. First set your fishing club leaflet on fire and throw it into the tank - then throw in two of the flammable items that contain alcohol: seeds, bottle or wet cloth. Then use the open pod.</p>

  <p>I escaped. Now what?</p>
  <p class="hint">Go back to the house and take and use the plates on the ground to get back into the cellar.</p>

  <p>Finally you and the old man are free again, but where's Vincent?</p>
  <p class="hint">Watch the last sequences for answers!</p>
